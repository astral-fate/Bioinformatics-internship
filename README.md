| Module | Main Topics Covered | Key Topics | Deliverables
|----------------|-------------------| ---- | ------ |
| [Module 2: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing](https://github.com/astral-fate/Bioinformatics-internship/tree/main/Module%202) | It go through the ncbi Publicly available datasets to retrieve isolates of pathogenic diseases |  Key topics: <br> -ncbi <br> - pathogonic diseases <br> | 
| [Module 3: Comprehensive Genome Analysis](https://github.com/astral-fate/Bioinformatics-internship/tree/main/Module%203) | This chapter focuses on MongoDB's various operators for constructing complex queries. It examines basic comparison operators ($eq, $gt, $gte, $lt, $lte), array operations ($in, $nin), and logical operators ($and, $or). The chapter includes detailed examples of range queries and demonstrates how to combine multiple operators for sophisticated data filtering. | | [Quiz 1](https://astral-fate.github.io/MongoDB-Comparison-and-Logic-Operators-quiz/)
| [Module 4: Genomic Insights into Drug Resistance and Mechanisms of Adaptation](https://github.com/astral-fate/Bioinformatics-internship/tree/main/Module%204) | This chapter introduces fundamental MongoDB operations, including index management, document operations, and querying. It covers creating and managing indexes, basic CRUD operations, find operations with various options, projection techniques, and results management through limiting, sorting, and counting. The chapter provides a comprehensive foundation in working with MongoDB's core functionality. |  - Key topics: <br>- Index Operations <br> - FindOne <br>  - FindMany<br> - DeleteOne <br> - DeleteMany<br> - Projection<br> - Sort<br> - Count<br>| 
| [Module 5: Statistical Analysis and Visual Representation of Resistome Profile Study](https://github.com/astral-fate/SE203-Advanced-Topics-in-Database/tree/main/MongoDB%20Database%20Structure%20and%20Operations) | This chapter examines MongoDB's database structure and CRUD operations in detail. It covers basic database operations including insert, update, and delete operations, explores advanced query operations with logical and comparison operators, and discusses database schema design with a focus on the company database structure. The chapter includes practical examples using a company database scenario. |
| [Module 6: Advanced MongoDB Topics - Aggregation Framework](https://github.com/astral-fate/SE203-Advanced-Topics-in-Database/tree/main/Advanced%20MongoDB%20Aggregation%20Framework)  | This chapter delves into MongoDB's powerful aggregation framework. It covers basic aggregation operations ($avg, $sum, $min, $max), group operations with $group and $id, sorting and filtering techniques, join operations using $lookup, and projection operations. The chapter provides in-depth coverage of data analysis and transformation capabilities in MongoDB.| | [Aggregation Quiz](https://astral-fate.github.io/Advanced-MongoDB-Aggregation-Framework-Quiz/)
| [Module 7: Comparative Genome Analysis (Insights into Spread and Transmission)] | This final chapter bridges MongoDB with Python through PyMongo. It covers connection setup, database operations, collection management, document operations, querying, index operations, and aggregation operations using Python. The chapter provides practical examples of implementing MongoDB operations in Python applications, complete with error handling and best practices.| | [PyMongo Quiz](https://astral-fate.github.io/PyMongo-Python-with-MongoDB/)
