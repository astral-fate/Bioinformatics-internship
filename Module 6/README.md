Based on the tutuorial, the following visualizations are requested:

- Gene against Sample ID

- Antibiotics class against Sample ID

- Antibiotics against Sample ID

- Classification against Sample ID

- Gene against Antibiotic class

- Gene against classification

- Antibiotics Class against Classification

We're expected to plot and visualize the relationship between the "Gene", "Antibiotics", “Antibiotics Class”, “Classification” for each different strain on same species and visualize how there connected to get the data in a more understandable way.
